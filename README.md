# cuda-testing
This is where I test out cuda things

Note that if you're developing on Windows, you need to install Visual Studio before installing CUDA

What I learned so far: CUDA was built for the Visual Studio 2019 preview, so we need to move some of the install files elsewhere to get 
things to build.
